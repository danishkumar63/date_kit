# date_kit

`date_kit` is a Dart package designed to facilitate working with `DateTime` objects by providing a comprehensive set of methods for performing various date and time operations. While `DateTime` objects in Dart are immutable, `date_kit` allows you to perform a wide range of operations on them, making date and time manipulation easier and more convenient.

This package was inspired by [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for JavaScript.
